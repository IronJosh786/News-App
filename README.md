# News-App
This is a completely responsive and interactive news application made using HTML, CSS &amp; Javascript.
It fetches news articles using the News API and displays them in a user-friendly format.

Due to the requirement of a priced plan for live API access, the News App is demonstrated through screenshots rather than a live demo. Screenshots are provided below to showcase various functionalities and the user interface at different breakpoints.
