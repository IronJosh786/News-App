# News-App
This is a completely responsive and interactive news application made using HTML, CSS &amp; Javascript.
It fetches news articles using the News API and displays them in a user-friendly format.

Due to the requirement of a priced plan for live API access, the News App is demonstrated through screenshots rather than a live demo. Screenshots are provided below to showcase various functionalities and the user interface at different breakpoints.

The application enables users to explore news articles by utilizing a search bar. Additionally, it offers navigation links for convenient access to popular topics such as technology, economics, and health.

The application is completely responsive and adapts gracefully to different screen sizes.
